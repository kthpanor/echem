ib general comment: we should add axis-labels and units to all graphs;
! we shouldn't forget to add the solutions!

impes:
	- give routine for eigenvalue solver
	- add comment in the code regarding the shape of deriv_q and second_deriv_q
	- impes tutorial too long; easy to get stuck with the conversion to internal coordinates -- consider giving more clues / less things to fill in
	- too long / difficult
	- struggle with transformations from cartesian to internal;
	- way to visualize; figures? shape of the matrices? what geometric returns?
	- worth having the exercise with the transformation;

optimization:
	-   
	
adc:
	- adc1; cvs, lih; cvs(nah) < cvs(lih);
	- no diagramms in the implementation;
	- diagrammatic derivation of the equations?
	- too short?
	- implement cvs-adc1 manually;
	- cvs-eigenvector, make it big, use as guess, then have the full space core-excited eigenvector -- possibly for transient X-ray absorption
	- theoretical lecture a bit longer?

general:
	- too many different blocks during the same day;
	- theory in the separate groups who choose
	- theory class per group? or all class do the same theory and tutorial
	- theory + break + practice the theory / exercises based on the theory which was presented; many things were compacted in a too short lecture;

td-scf: 
	- all info, final exercise; intermediate interactive learning missing;
	- better format: info + interactive part + exercise; info + interactive part + exercise
	- missing part of "learning it" -- 
	- comparison to adc(2). Adc(2) comes after, so it does not come naturally (links?)

veloxchem:
	- not idiot-proof enough; dft theory always used hf; not easy to figure out how to set the functional;
	- you will never be corrected on anything because the veloxchem uses dictionaries;
	- no way to know what variables are available 
	- ib: suggestion - for eChem, don't use update settings, but use attributes and instance variables of the object.
	- some basis sets fo not work; -- perhaps should not be allowed;
	- different basis sets for different atoms?
	- ECPs?

uv-vis:
	- xtb -- should be fixed for conda such that veloxchem is compiled with xtb;
	- more description in these sections

x-ray:
	- issues with visualization (for Karan) -- 
	- spin_flip is not possible with gator, because it only runs a restricted scf!
	- some things are not intuitive?

workshop:
	- good milestone; some blocks were straightforward; some were for advanced user
	- it was not easy to know what routines one can use;
	- a routine of what is available for each driver;
	- links and cheatsheet with useful commands?

Format: lecture + tutorial on one topic;

Cover everything it is too much
so, select some methods;
ground state, then excited states, then properties

Exercise together with the theory?
Link to exercises from the theory section?
TDDFT: add quadratic response to the eChem book -- important feature of vlx, so should be added
-- two-photon absorption; at least in tutorial part.

Scope of workshop was not clear; For people interested in application: too difficult;
for people who are developers into programming -- not enough theory?
Exercises throughout theory -- to satisfy developers
Exercises which are more applied -- to satisfy the application people
We should have more exercises the whole time -- even during the theory side:

Introduce Fock matrix -- then construct the Fock matrix
move to the next theory part; -- do it in practice,
etc.

CASSCF -- you already have to know what is going on under the hood;

focus on equation implementation; full derivation
main steps -- derivation; balance between 

lectures:
	echem people -- very aligned with echem content; external people -- less aligned
	
	- geometry + impes: 
		* 
	- tddft:
		* basics + too easy -- stop saying it is too easy;
		* not consistent notation?? 
		* in eChem: more derivations in TDDFT part
		* Andreas' derivation was in different formalism compared to eChem formalism
	- adc
		*
	- exciton coupling
		*

Two versions of the workshop: one for developers and one for applied research
