# General aspects

In this section we will cover general aspects of electronic structure theory calculations.

- [Orbitals](orbitals) <br>
An introduction to wave functions and operators for single-electron systems is given.
- [Basis sets](basis) <br>
How to interact with and use the basis set library.
- [Slater determinants](slater) <br>
An introduction to wave functions and operators for many-electron systems is given. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian serves as numerical example.
- [Second quantization](secondquant) <br>
A presentation of the occupation number formalism is given.
