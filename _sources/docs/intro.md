# Getting started

## Our vision

The group of people behind the eChem team is engaged in education and research activities in theoretical chemistry. As an integrated component of this work, we develop software for the simulation of complex molecular systems and this e-book lets you explore the fruits of these efforts. We have an overreaching vision and goal to provide:

> A science- and education-enabling software platform for quantum molecular modeling on contemporary and future high-performance computing (HPC) systems
>> Software to meet the challenges of the [EuroHPC project](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/)

Behind the term **science-enabling** there are a multitude of software requirements that we find important in our work, including

- coverage of dense 3D system of sizes up to and beyond 500 atoms in the quantum region
- accurate description of electronically excited states that show a more diffuse character than the ground state
- stable and reliable convergence of iterative equation solvers also with use of diffuse basis sets
- time-efficient prototyping of novel scientific approaches
- transparent exposure of data structures to enable in-depth analyses for standard users
- flexible ways to interact with other components of the simulation (such as molecular dynamics, parameterizing the embedding, and data visualization)
- a fast return of results so as to remain in synchronicity with experimental project partners, enabled by an efficient, memory-conservative, hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization and SIMD vectorization in core software modules

The term **education-enabling** adds another set of software requirements to this already long list. In this context, the notion of deeper learning refers to taking each studentâ€™s understanding of the subject matter to another (deeper) level. Our experience tells us that the process of implementing methods to solve fundamental equations is supremely efficient as a means to achieve that type of deeper learning, but only a small number of students are granted this opportunity as many core modules of scientific software were written a long time ago and have often been made obscure by code optimization. What if we could instead offer access to the needed building blocks to explore quantum chemistry in very much the same manner that we can use the Python NumPy package to explore linear algebra?
