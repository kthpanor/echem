    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows are some general suggestions for practical calculations, which is naturally an incomplete list with some of the Authors' biases unavoidably being included. Consider this as a helpful guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Precision* versus *accuracy*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the many difficulties in modeling X-ray spectra (relativity, relaxation, self-interaction, high energies...), even very sophisticated (and expensive!) methods often struggles in getting good *absolute* energies. These cannot be expected to be as good as for valence excitations. We argue that the focus should be more on properly reproducing *relative* rather than *absolute* trends, which can be formulated as focusing on  precision over accuracy, where\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy correspond to the deviation from the absolute energies and intensities, or the systematic error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision focus on the reproducability of relative energies and intensities, or (relative) error distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have shown that good accuracy does not necessarily correspond to as good precision {cite}`xaboom2021`, and our philosophy is that obtaining good trends and relative errors is typically sufficient for practical studies (provided we have some understanding of the source of the absolute error, and good reasons to think that it will not differ between systems/geometries). Absolute errors can then be corrected by a mere absolute shift in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in particularly the case when TDDFT is used for considering X-ray properties, as most attempts to improving the accuracy in practise corresponds to a cancellation of lack of relaxation/self-interaction error. We argue that this approach is equally valid as introducing a common shift, obtained wither by comparison to experiment or based on, *e.g.*, $\\Delta$SCF.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electronic stucture method\n",
    "\n",
    "Single determinant wave function methods can include relaxation by the use of (at least) doubly excited configurations. These methods tend to yield relatively consistent description of the processes, and are thus recommended to be used for (at least) controls. Due to the cost, however, they are often unviable for larger systems. Families and recommendations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupled cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    - CCSD has been noted to yield provide good prevision and reasonable accuracy for XAS and XES {cite}`cvseomccsd2019, eomccxes2012`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - CC3 has been seen to improve the XAS results, and can be used in a multilayer manner {cite}`cc3imp2020`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If computational cost is a concern, CC2 has been seen to work quite well {cite}`xaboom2021`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Algebraic-diagrammatic construction scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ADC(2) yields superiour results for XES, and works quite well for the valence states in XAS (the shift to higher-lying features are likely to be compressed, however) {cite}`adcxes2019, xaboom2021`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ADC(2)-x has been noted to yield best results for XAS, despite being quite unsuitable for valence excitations {cite}`cvsadc32015`. This has been identified as a result of balancing effects for capturing the strong relaxation effects in XAS\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ADC(3/2) has been noted to yield a poorer description of both XAS and XES, despite its higher level of theory and higher computational cost {cite}`cvsadc32015, adcxes2019, xaboom2021`. *However*, for X-ray emission spectra of systems in an environment, double-excitations may interfer with the emission lines for ADC(2) and ADC(2)-x. ADC(3/2) will then be most suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With TDDFT (or CPP-DFT), the exchange-correlation functional depends on the edge and the element, as the exact balance of relaxation and self-interaction varies significantly {cite}`coretddft2010`. Good absolute energies are often obtained by balancing the error of the lack of relaxation versus the self-interaction, which is achieved by changing the amount of HF exchange. Focusing on the second row we have seen that {cite}`xaboom2021`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAM-B3LYP (potentially using 100% asymptotic HF) has been seen to yield good relative energies (precision), but poor absolute energies (accuracy). Intensitites are also quite good, so a mere absolute shift often yield good agreement with experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SRC2-R1 is from a family of short-range correlated functionals, formulated for good absolute XAS energies. \n",
    "\n",
    "If static correlation becomes substantial, methods based on a single Slater determinant reference will become unsuitable. ADC will be worst off, on account of the MP reference, with CC being slightly more successful for these cases. Spin-flip ADC and CC can improve the situation for certain few-reference systems. TDDFT will be a bit more capable of considering these cases. However, systems with strong static correlation should be considered carefully, and multi-reference methods are likely the safest way forward. Here an appropriate active space need to be carefully selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition-metal complexes often have strong static correlation, which would point towards using multi-reference methods. TDDFT can also work quite well, and in some cases ADC or CC provides reliable results as well. Care need to be taken if the latter methods are used. Furthermore, TM complexes can need (spin-orbit) relativistic effects, and quadruple-allowed transition can become substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plethora of other methods for considering X-ray properties are available,  for which guides and recommendations have to be found elsewhere (*e.g.* {cite}`xrayrev2018`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basis set selection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously [discussed](sec:xray_topics_basis), standard basis set often include a minimal, or close to minimal, basis set for the core region, as computational chemistry commonly focus on the valence electrons. For core spectroscopies this region thus often need to be augmented by some method, which may include decontracting core basis functions, including core-polarizing functions, augmenting the basis set with basis functions for $Z+1$ or $Z+1/2$, or some other method {cite}`basisXray2018, basisxas2021`. It can be noted, however, that this augmentation is not always necessary for high precision, provided that the lacking description of the core region yield similar errors for different states and/or atomic sites {cite}`xaboom2021`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, our general recommendation would be to use cc-pCVTZ for the atoms probed, and cc-pVTZ for the remaining atoms. Dunning basis set 6-311G\\*\\* has also been seen to perform quite well, and the core basis functions can here be decontracted for u6-311G\\*\\*. Hydrogen atoms and atoms away from the probed core orbitals can likely be dropped to a double-$\\zeta$ desciption. A double-$\\zeta$ (*e.g.* cc-pVDZ/cc-pCVDZ or 6-31G\\*/u6-31G\\*) can be used with some care for larger systems and more approximate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XPS:** If some $\\Delta\\textrm{SCF}$ method is used, a flexible description of the core and valence region is desirable\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XAS:** Probes unoccupied states, and thus need to be augmented to describe this region. For the valence-type final states it is likely to be sufficient to add more diffuse functions, *i.e.* aug-cc-pCVTZ or 6-311++G\\*\\*. Core-polarizing function or similar may not be necessary, and extra diffuse functions on hydrogen is typically not needed. Furthermore, if Rydberg/mixed-Rydberg states are to be studied, augmentation with additional (Rydberg-like) diffuse function can be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XES:** Largely have similar requirements as XPS, albeit may need a better description in the (outer) valence region\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RIXS:** Probes both the occupied and unoccupied states, and thus need a good (and balanced) description of both. The recommendations for XAS and XES can thus be considered to transfer over to this spectroscopy\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for heavier atoms the core region contains several shells. As the core-polarizing functions are formulated to capture core-valence correlation, it will then more efficiently augment the outer, rather than the inner, core region. As such, additional (inner) core basis functions would be needed for approaching the basis set limit of these atoms. Still, with the discussion of precision above, the weak interaction between the inner core and valence region means that core-polarization may anyway just yield an absolute error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relativistic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "If the *K*-edge is considered, only scalar relativistic effects are present in the transition, the inclusion of which can be done with X2C or Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonians. Alternatively, it is often sufficient to just add an absolute scalar shift in energy for a non-relativistic calculation (such a shift is likely needed anyway, as absolute energies are notoriously hard to reproduce). This absolute shift can be estimated by simple MO energy calculations, as [previously](sec:xray_topics_rel_ip) shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *l>0* is to be considered, spin-orbit splitting effects will potentially be substantial. The inclusion of these are currently beyond the scope of this tutorial."
