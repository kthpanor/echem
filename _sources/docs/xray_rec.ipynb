    "What follows are some general suggestions for practical calculations, which is naturally an  incomplete list with some of the Authors biases unavoidably being included. Consider this as a helpful guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Precision* versus *accuracy*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the many difficulties in modeling X-ray spectra (relativity, relaxation, self-interaction, high energies...), even very sophisticated (and expensive!) methods often struggles in getting good *absolute* energies. These cannot be expected to be as good as for valence excitations. I argue that the focus should be more on properly reproducing *relative* rather than *absolute* trends, which can be formulated as focusing on  precision over accuracy, where\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy correspond to the deviation from the absolute energies and intensities, or the systematic error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision focus on the reproducability of relative energies and intensities, or (relative) error distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have [shown] that good accuracy does not nedessarily correspond to as good precision, and our philosophy is that obtaining good trends and relative errors is sufficient for prectical studies (provided we have some idea of the source of the absolute error, and good reasons to think that it will noit differ between the systems). Absolute errors can then be corrected by a mere absolute shift in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electronic stucture method\n",
    "\n",
    "Single determinant wave function methods can include relaxation by the use of (at least) doubly excited configurations. These methods tend to yield relatively consistent description of the processes, and are thus recommended to be used for (at least) controls. Due to the cost, however, they are often unviable for larger systems. Families and recommendations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupled cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    - CCSD has been noted to yield consistent results for XAS and XES, and \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - CC3 has been seen to improve the XAS results, and can be used in a multilayer manner\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If computational cost is a concern, CC2 has been seen to work quite well\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Algebraic-diagrammatic construction scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ADC(2) yields superiour results for XES, and works quite well for the valence states in XAS (the shift to higher-lying features are likely to be compressed, however). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ADC(2)-x has been noted to yield best results for XAS, despite being quite unsuitable for valence excitations. This has been identified as a result of balancing effects for capturing the strong relaxation effects in XAS.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ADC(3/2) has been noted to yield a poorer description of both XAS and XES, despite its higher level of theory and higher computational cost. *However*, for X-ray emission spectra of systems in an environment, double-excitations may interfer with the emission states for ADC(2) and ADC(2)-x. ADC(3/2) will then be most suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With TDDFT (or CPP-DFT), the exchange-correlation functional depends on the edge and the element, as the exact balance of relaxation and self-interaction varies significantly. Good absolute energies are often obtained by balancing the error of the lack of relaxation versus the self-interaction, which is achieved by changing the amount of HF exchange. Focusing on the second row we have seen that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAM-B3LYP (potentially using 100% asymptotic HF) has been seen to yield good relative energies (precision), but poor absolute energies (accuracy). Intensitites are also quite good, so a mere absolute shift often yield good agreement with experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SRC2-R1 is from a family of short-range correlated functionals, formulated for good absolute XAS energies. \n",
    "\n",
    "If static correlation becomes substantial, methods based on a single Slater determinant reference will become unsuitable. ADC will be worst off, on account of the MP reference, with CC being slightly more successful for these cases. Spin-flip ADC and CC can improve the situation for certain few-reference systems. TDDFT will be a bit more capable of considering these cases. However, systems with strong static correlation should be studied carefully, and multi-reference methods are likely the safest way forward. Need to know which active space to choose, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition-metal complexes can have strong static correlation, which would aim to multi-reference methods. For some cases ADC or CC works quite well - just check it. Furthermore, TM complexes can need (spin-orbit) relativistic effects, and quadruple-allowed transition can become substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods, such as... can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basis set selection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously [discussed], standard basis set often include a minimal, or close to minimal, basis set for the core region, as computational chemistry commonly focus on the valence electrons. For core spectroscopies this region thus often need to be augmented by some method, which may include decontracting core basis functions, including core-polarizing functions, augmenting the basis set with basis functions for $Z+1$ or $Z+1/2$, or some other method. It can be noted, however, that this augmentation is not necissary for high precision, provided that the lacking description of the core region yield similar errors for different states and/or atomic sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, my general recommendation would be to use cc-pCVTZ for the atoms probed, and cc-pVTZ for the remaining atoms. Dunning basis set 6-311G\\*\\* has also been seen to perform quite well, and the core basis functions can here be decontracted for u6-311G\\*\\*. Hydrogen atoms and atoms away from the probed core orbitals can likely be dropped to a double-$\\zeta$ desciption. A double-$\\zeta$ (*e.g.* cc-pVDZ/cc-pCVDZ or 6-31G\\*/u6-31G\\*) can be used with some care for larger systems and more approximate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XPS:** If some $\\Delta\\textrm{SCF}$ method is used, a flexible description of the core and valence region \n",
    "\n",
    "- **XAS:** Probes unoccupied states, and thus need to be augmented to describe this region. For the valence-type final states it is likely to be sufficient to add more diffuse functions, *i.e.* aug-cc-pCVTZ or 6-311++G\\*\\*. Adding the Dunning diffuse functions are likely not necessary for hydrogen. Furthermore, if Rydberg/mixed-Rydberg states are to be studied, augmentation with additional diffuse function can be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XES:** Shares requirements with XPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RIXS:** Probes both the occupied and unoccupied states, and thus need a good (and balanced) description of both. The recommendations for XAS and XES can thus be considered to transfer over to this spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for heavier atoms the core region contains several shells. As the core-polarizing functions are formulated to capture core-valence correlation, it will then more efficiently augment the outer, rather than the inner, core region. AS such, additional (inner) core basis functions would be needed for approaching the BSL of these atoms. Still, with the discussion of precision above, the weak interaction between the inner core and valence region means that core-polarization may anyway just yield an absolute error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relativistic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "If the *K*-edge is considered, scalar relativistic effects are only needed, as can be done with X2C or Douglas-Kroll-Hess. Alternatively, it is often sufficient to just add an absolute scalar shift in energy for a non-relativistic calculation (such a shift is likely needed anyway, as absolute energies are notoriously hard to reproduce). This absolute shift can be estimated by simple MO energy calculations, as shown [above].\n",
    "\n",
    "If *l>0* is to be considered, spin-orbit splitting effects will potentially be substantial. Including this can be done with..."
