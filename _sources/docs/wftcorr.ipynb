    "## Second quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "The second quantization representation of electronic Hamiltonian and associated quantities in many cases provides a more straightforward and compact way to derive various wave function models than the conventional approach based on the direct application of Slater-Condon rules to individual Slater determinants.  For example, derivation of working equations for coupled-cluster singles and doubles wave function in second quantization becomes a single lecture affair, compared to the conventional way, which is several days undertaking. Thus, the second quantization is a valuable mathematical tool for working with correlated wave functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical apparatus of second quantization is based on two key ingredients: the creation/annihilation operators and the definition of particle space on which these operators act. To define creation and annihilation operators acting on spin-orbital $\\psi(\\mathbf{x})$\\footnote{Here, we use combined electron coordinate $\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{r}, s)$ composed of spatial $\\mathbf{r}$ and spin $s$ coordinates of electron.} we define Fock space, which is postulated to be abstract vector space of occupation vectors which uniquely maps to Slater determinants. To illustrate the concept of occupation number vector, let us consider Fock space consisting from three spin-orbitals: $\\psi_1(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\psi_2(\\mathbf{x})$, and $\\psi_3(\\mathbf{x})$. The Slater determinant for two electrons occupying $\\psi_1(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\psi_2(\\mathbf{x})$ spin-orbitals $1/\\sqrt{2} |\\psi_1(\\mathbf{x}) \\psi_2(\\mathbf{x}) |$ in Fock space represented as occupation number vector $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = | 1 1 0 \\rangle$.

    "An alternative way of getting the molecular orbital integrals is through the direct formation of many Fock matrices. Taking the $\\langle ij|ab \\rangle$ integrals as an example, we can in practice build $N_{occ} \\times N_{occ}$ density matrices using the coefficients of the occupied orbitals, and form the corresponding Fock matrices that can then be transformed into molecular basis by the coefficients of the virtual orbitals. \n",

    "The computational cost of this approach is formally $O(N^6)$; however, in practice the cost scales between $O(N^4)$ and $O(N^5)$ due to screening of integrals in the formation of Fock matrices. An advantage of this approach is that the Fock matrices can be computed and stored on individual compute nodes, making it suitable for large-scale parallelization on HPC systems."
