    "## Relaxation\n",
    "\n",
    "Core spectroscopies exhibit strong relaxation effects, originating in the significant change in shielding of the nuclear charge arising from the creation/annihilation of a core-hole. These effects need to be properly accounted for in order to get good absolute energies, as  the lack of this will mean that, *e.g.* an unrelaxed core-hole system is too high in energy. This explains the previously [observed](sec:xray_calc_iekoop) large error obtained using Koopmans' theorem.\n",

These effects can be modeled with the $Z+1$ approximation, within which the change in screening is modeled by substituting the ionized atom with the next element in the periodic table. This can be illustrated with the following radial distribution plots (using uncontracted 6-31G basis sets, in order to increase flexibility in the core region):\n",

    "As can be seen, the smallest discrepancy for XAS is observed for CVS-ADC(2)-x, and for XES it is here noted to be for ADC(3/2). In general, it has been noted that CVS-ADC(2)-x performs best for [XAS](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4921841), and ADC(2) for [XES](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01046) (in terms of absolute energies - for relative features ADC(2)-x performs a bit [better](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-vllwh-v2)). As ADC(3/2) is correct in higher order of perturbation theory and perform well for valence excitation, it could be expected to also perform best for core properties. The fact that this is not the case has [been](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4921841) [noted](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01046) to be due to balancing in relaxation effects, which are highly influential for core properties and vary significantly between XAS and XES.\n",

    "When using a $\\Delta$KS approach, relaxation is explicitly accounted for, as discussed [above](sec:xray_delta_rel). By contrast, TDDFT is a single-excitation theory which cannot properly account for relaxation (which requires doubly-excited configuration in a response theory framework), although it can be partially accounted for through some separate correction scheme. The error introduced by a lack of relaxation will furthermore be counteracted by the self-interaction error, as is discussed [below](sec:xray_topics_sie).\n",

    "Relativistic effects are siginificantly stronger for core than valence MOs, on account of the strong potential experienced by the core orbitals. These effects mainly influences calculated properties in two separate manners:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scalar relativistic effects, which are always present and lead to a contraction (and thus increase in binding energy) of core orbitals. Higher lying orbitals (especially for $l>1$) can become decontracted due to increasing screening from contracted MOs, but this effect is typically much smaller than for, *e.g.*, 1s\n",

    "2. Spin-orbit coupling, which breaks degeneracies for MOs of $l>0$ and is thus negligible for, *e.g.*, the $K$- and $L_1$-edges (as the splitting for valence MOs is much smaller), but very important for, *e.g.*, the $L_{2,3}$-edge\n",

    "### Scalar relativistic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Including scalar relativistic effects is relatively straight-forward, as a number of Hamiltonians are available which can include these effects in a 1-component framework. Furthermore, the effects are typically quite stable over the separate elements, and it can thus often be considered as a common absolute off-set in energy. It should be noted that the (scalar) relativistic effects are technically not additive with electron correlation, such that a proper consideration should account for both simultaneously. In practise, this discrepancy is small and relativistc shifts from lower level of theory is typically sufficient.\n",

For the $\\Delta$SCF calculation, however, only approximately half the relaxation energy is accounted for using a delocalized core-hole. Such a discrepancy for delocalized calculations of IP:s have been noted in previously, and it has been associated with missing correlation effects which are required to properly correct the delocalized calculation. Within a full CI scheme, delocalization will no longer be an issue (and it will capture the small shift in energy between the gerade and ungerade core-hole).\n",

    "We see that considering each MO in turn works well for vinylfluoride, where the two carbon 1s are localized, but not for ethene, where they are delocalized. Including or not including fluorine here makes little difference, as that MO is both energetically and spatially well separated from the carbon 1s.\n",

Care should be taken for larger systems, and explicitly looking at the MOs is adviced.

    "Within a damped response theory framwork or when performing explicit real-time propagation, a CVS-like scheme which separates core-transitions from the valence-continuum is usually not performed. If such calculations are run with a atom-centered basis set (as most are), this can then lead to spurious mixing with valence-excited states. What happens is that resonances in the valence-continuum occur close to core-excitations, leading to unphysical mixing which affects excitation energies and (more significantly) intensities. These issues occur both for methods featuring only single-excited configurations (*e.g.* TDDFT) and higher-excited configurations (*e.g.* ADC) and need to be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue has been observed for, *e.g.*, $L_{2,3}$-edge of silicon {cite}`xas4crttddft, ledge2016`, and is usually more common at lower energies. They can be identified by studying the amplitudes and the $t^2$ values for post-HF methods, and can be avoided by chosing appropriate basis set, freezing certain virtual orbitals, or by re-introducing the CVS approximation (or some other flavour) within the CPP/RT framework. The latter is noted to be recommended in any case for CPP-ADC, as converging the response vectors has otherwise been seen to be difficult {cite}`gator`."
