Since the polarizability is already a second-order (or linear-response) property, this is more involved than IR intensities (in the time-independent regime, the polarizability gradient corresponds to a third derivative of the energy). However, it turns that out the analytical nuclear gradient of the polarizability can be calculated in manner analogous to the gradients of the TDHF or TDDFT schemes {cite}`Rappoport2007`, which is similar to what has been discussed for [here](sec:tdhf-gradients). \n",
