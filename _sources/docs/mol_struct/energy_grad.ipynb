    "methods, i.e., HF and Kohn--Sham DFT, these are the molecular-orbital (MO) coefficients, which exhibit an implicit dependence on the nuclear coordinates when atom-centered basis functions such as Gaussian or Slater-type atomic orbitals (AOs) are used. Considering this implicit dependence, the total energy derivative with respect to a particular nuclear coordinate $x$ is obtained via the chain rule {cite}`Rehn2015,Levchenko2005`\n",

The second term stems from the implicit dependence of the energy on $x$ due to the fact that the molecular orbitals are expanded in a finite atomic-centered basis set {cite}`Helgaker1988_analytical` \n",
    "%This term would vanish if a basis set independent on atomic positions, for example a plane wave basis, were used.\n",

    "It may seem at first surprising that the derivative ${\\partial E}/{\\partial\\mathbf{C}}$ has to be computed. If the MO coefficients are obtained variationally for a specified molecular geometry, how is it that this derivative is not zero? The key to this conundrum lies in the phrase \"for a specified molecular geometry\". Since the SCF energy and density are constructed using a constrained LCAO parametrization, if we perform a nuclear displacement, the \"old\" MO coefficients no longer correspond to the minimum energy and must be re-optimized. Thus the partial derivative with respect to the MO coefficients, as well as the derivative of the MO coefficients with respect to $x$ are required. The explicit computation of the latter is complicated, but can be avoided by making use of a new functional, the Lagrangian, for which the partial derivative $\\partial L / \\partial \\mathbf{C}$ is zero and constrained to the HF/DFT configuration space by construction {cite}`Levchenko2005, Helgaker2014`\n",

    "%From Helgaker and Jorgensen:\"At each geometry we have a set of AOs  from  which an infinite set of orthogonally equivalent orbital bases can be constructed. As the geometry changes we must pick out exactly one of these orbital bases at each geometry $\\mathbf{X}$. In this way an orthogonal  orbital connection is established. (A connection is called orthogonal if it  preserves orthonormality between the orbitals.) We further  require that the connection is continuous and differentiable. One may also wish to impose an additional requirement on the connection, namely that it  is translationally and rotationally  invariant. This may seem to be a trivial requirement. However, a connection is conveniently defined in terms of atomic Cartesian displacements rather than in terms of a set of nonredundant internal coordinates. This implies that each molecular geometry may be described in an infinite number of translationally and rotationally equivalent ways\"\n",
