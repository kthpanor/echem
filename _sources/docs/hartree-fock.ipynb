    "\n",
    "With the state of the system being described by a single Slater determinant, the Hartree–Fock wave function is given as that which minimizes the electronic energy in a variational sense with respect to variations in the spin orbitals. It represents a cornerstone in quantum chemistry and provides total electronic energies that are within 1% of the exact results and a wide range of molecular properties that are within 5–10% accuracy. Moreover, the Hartree–Fock method serves as starting points for the formulation of many other, more accurate, wave function methods as well as the Kohn–Sham formulation of density functional theory.\n",

But it is also required to save Fock matrices and error vectors from previous SCF iteration. In practice, however, this extra storage requirement does not severely hamper applications, and in particular so as an optimum stabilitity in the DIIS scheme is experienced with the use of information from a limited number (about 10) of the previous iterations."
