    "Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The conda repository contains a large number of open-source certified packages enabling scientific work. It is recommended that you install the minimal installer for conda named [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. \n",

    "Start a conda terminal, or Anaconda Powershell as it is referred to on a Windows system. Conda supports multiple *environments* and you start in the one named `base` as is typically indicated by the prompt. The packages required by eChem is then most conveniently installed by the [echem.yml](https://github.com/kthpanor/echem/blob/master/echem.yml) file (except for Windows user---see [below](sec:windows_conda)).
