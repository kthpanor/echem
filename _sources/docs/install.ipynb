    "Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The conda repository contains a large number of open-source certified packages enabling scientific work. It is recommended that you install the minimal installer for conda named [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. \n",

    "The new `conda-libmamba-solver` run much faster than the previous solver, as discussed in [this blog post](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/conda-is-fast-now). We thus recommend that you use libmamba, which is the [default](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-05-conda-libmamba-solver-rollout/) for newer conda distributions. In order to check which version you are using, run `conda info` and you find the solver in use under `user-agent`. If your distribution does not use libmamba, this can be done by updating conda, installing the new solver to your base environment, and configuring your selection:\n",
