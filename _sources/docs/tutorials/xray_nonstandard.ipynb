    "\n",
    "An increasingly large field of study is to use a pump-probe protocol, where some chemical reaction is initiated by some pump (typically a laser), and the dynamics are then probed using some X-ray spectroscopy. The modeling of such process is quite new, and we will here present some protocols of how such processes can be considered.\n",

    "### Valence-excited reference state\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an excited state as the references state, the X-ray absorption spectra can be considered in a manner similar to XES:\n",
    "1. Perform a ground state calculation\n",
    "2. Use the result as initial guess for a second calculation, where the occupations are changed to emulate that of the desired (valence) excited state\n",
    "3. Perform a wave function optimization with above configuration, using a constraint such as MOM to avoid a collapse to the ground state\n",
    "4. Calculate the X-ray absorption spectra of this reference state\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering (singlet) valence-excitations of a closed-shell molecule, two different reference state spin-muliticiplicity configurations are possible:\n",
    "- Low-spin open-shell reference (LSOR), which moves an electron within the same multiplicity\n",
    "- High-spin open-shell reference (HSOR), which flips the spin of the moved electron, and thus forms a triplet reference state (when considering singlet excitations of a closed-shell system)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the LSOR wave function will be heavily spin contaminated, as seen below. This has been claimed to lead to minimal errors, but care should be taken. Further note that converging to a reference state which represents the actual valence excitation is non-trivial, and may indeed be all but impossible. As such, this two-step approach is useful, but has some issues. Finally, if using correlated methods, there are some concerns that the [observed](https://doi.org/10.1063%2F4.0000070) relative energies are off from experimental values, which could relate to issues with using a [non-Aufbau](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP00584K) reference state.\n",
