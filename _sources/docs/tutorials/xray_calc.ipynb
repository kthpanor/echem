The overestimation of almost 20 eV is due to lack of [relaxation](sec:xray_topics_relax), which results from the reorganization of the valence electrons in response to a reduction in screening of the nuclei. By comparison, in valence spectroscopies the change in shielding is significantly smaller, yielding far smaller errors due to the lack of relaxation.\n",

    "In a normal SCF cycle without constraints, the core-ionized state is not possible to converge since it collapses into a lower-energy valence-ionized state. To obtain a core-hole state, an approach which avoids the convergence to the valence-hole state is needed. This can be done using several approaches, but the focus here will be on the maximum overlap method (MOM). The idea behind MOM is to run an SCF optimization with the constraint of maximizing the overlap of the orbitals to some initial guess {cite}`mom1961, mom1967, mom1971, maxover2008`. The guess is typically taken as the converged wave function of the neutral (no core-hole) system, and new occupied orbitals at each iteration are chosen such that they overlap most with the span of old occupied orbitals.

    "2. Use this as a starting guess for a new wave-function optimization, removing an electron from the desired orbital (and potentially occupying some other virtual orbital).\n",
    "\n",
