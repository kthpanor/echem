    "# Larger systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will consider some aspects which are important for considering larger systems. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost-saving measures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inclusion of an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupling to molecular dynamics simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The building-block principle\n",
    "\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the examples that are to be added here will be calculated on a larger cluster, as they are often too costly to run on a laptop. Cells are thus to be included only as static code, with results taken from separate calculations.\n",

    "Will considering transition metal complex with low degree of static correlation, such that TDDFT and ADC can be used. Spectra can then be calculated using using:\n",
