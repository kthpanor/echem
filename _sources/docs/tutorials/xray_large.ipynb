    "This section is to be added, and currently only contains internal notes of what will be included.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will consider some aspects which are important for considering larger systems. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost-saving measures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inclusion of an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupling to molecular dynamics simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The building-block principle\n",
    "\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the examples that are to be added here will be calculated on a larger cluster, as they are often too costly to run on a laptop. Cells are thus to be included only as static code, with results taken from separate calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Valence-to-core XES\n",
    "\n",
    "Will considering transition metal complex with low degree of static correlation, such that TDDFT and ADC can be used. Consider using:\n",

    "- Ground state MOs\n",

    "- TDDFT\n",

    "### Uracil with CVS-ADC(2)-x\n",

    "1. Gas phase\n",

    "2. Environment with PE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phthalocyanine with TDDFT\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider phthalocyanine (or similar system) with TDDFT. Focus on just making it work, so not necessarily including an environment.\n",
