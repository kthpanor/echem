    "# Open-shells and static correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will describe how to treat open-shell molecules as well as molecules where a the problem of static/strong correlation, which is when a single determinant is not even qualitatively a proper description of the system. In this chapter we will restrict ourselves to a non-relativistic description without external magmetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High spin cases\n",
    "### Single-reference methods\n",
    "\n",
    "By high-spin case we refer to open-shell cases where we can choose all non-paired electrons to be $\\alpha$. Of course, in non-relativistic description without external magmetic field, we could have equivalently chosen all non-paired electrons to be $\\beta$, but the former is chosen by convention. The reason why this case is the simplest is that, as mentioned in  {ref}`sec:spin`, these high-spin cases can be represented by a single Slater Determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to describe such a system:\n",
    "* Keeping the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals identical but populating the $\\alpha$ orbitals with more electrons. This is called a restricted open-shell calculation.\n",
    "* Using different orbitals for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals. This is called an unrestricted calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate these two different concepts on probably the most common open-shell molecule on earth, the oxygen molecule:"

    "Disappointingly, there is no difference beyond numerical noise. The problem is that the open-shell unrestricted solution exists, but the closed-shell solution is a stable point. Since there is no magnetic field, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons experience the same force, and there is no reason therefore for the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals to differ. The minimization is stuck in a symmetric solution. In the high-spin case, this symmetry was broken by the fact that we had more $\\alpha$ electrons than $\\beta$, thus creating a different field.\n",

    "To change this and find the lower solution, we need to break the symmetry, and hence, the resulting solution will be called \"broken symmetry solution\". Codes sometimes offer a keyword to actively break the symmetry. Here we will use the maximum overlap method to create a different starting occupation for the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals."
