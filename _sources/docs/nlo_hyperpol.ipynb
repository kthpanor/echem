    "When stydying physical processes as the interaction of radiation with matter, in a vast majority of cases experiments are performed on fluids. To connect theory and the results of such experiments and to derive expression for the observables, it is necessary to take into account the random orientation of the molecules. This is usually done by deriving results for for a system with fixed orientation and then carry on ann orientartional average. The general expression of the observable $T$ has the form\n",

In one-photon absorption for instance, the transition rate (observable, out $T$ here) is connected with two second order tensors, say ${\\mathbf A}$ containing information on the polarization of the radiation and say $\\mathbf P$, relates to the square of the transition moment. The tensor components of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{P}$ are usually given in a common frame, f.ex. and most commonly a space-fixed frame, chosen often in a way that the polarization information in $\\mathbf{A}$ might be expressed straighforwardly. For a randomly oriented system then the components of $\\mathbf{P}$ are re-xpressed with respect to the space-fixed frame by employing the director cosines of the angle betwen the spac-fixed and the molecule-fix angles $l_{i_p \\lambda_p}$\n",
