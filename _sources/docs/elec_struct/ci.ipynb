    "## The $N$-electron basis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in principle an infinite number of possible $N$-electron basis to choose from, but we ideally want the expansion to converge quickly (compact expansion) and the functions to be easily manipulatable to efficiently compute the Hamiltonian elements. Naturally, these two criteria often go opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "As electron correlation depends on the distance between electrons, it would be natural to use functions that depend explicitly on this distance, the same way as our gaussian or Slater 1-electron basis depends explicitly on the distance between electron and nuclei. Wavefunctions having these properties are typically called explicitly correlated wavefunctions, but this interelectronic distance makes the calculation of integrals very difficult as it couples multiple electrons together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often drop this explicit dependence and instead use a wavefunction that is simply formed from products of one-electron functions, i.e., product of orbitals. The simplest of these basis functions is the Hartree product, but since we know the wavefunction should be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons, we instead use the antisymmetrised version of the Hartree product: Slater determinants (SDs). As each SD represents a different electronic configuration, the resulting method is called configuration interaction (CI). As discussed in the previous sections, this basis of SDs constitutes a complete basis within a specified one-electron basis set, and thus the solution obtained by minimizing the energy of this wavefunction is the exact ground state within that one-electron basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some codes, configuration state functions (CSF) are used instead of SDs. CSF are fixed linear combinations of SDs but with the attractive properties that they are also eigenfunctions of the $\\hat{S}^2$ spin operator. This spin constraints means that the resulting wavefunction will always be spin-adapted and also that CSF are less numerous than Slater determinants, which has advantages on a computational standpoint. However, SDs can be expressed as ordered \"strings\" of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ creating operators, and this separation of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons allows for efficient computer implementations, outweighing the benefits of the slightly smaller expansion of CSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having chosen SDs as our basis functions, we now need an efficient way to create our expansion, i.e., a direct link between a given index in our expansion and the corresponding occupation of the SDs. This link should work both ways, matching a given occupation to the corresponding index in the expansion. A common choice is the so-called lexical ordering or the reverse lexical ordering. The details are beyond the scope of this page, but fortunately, the MultiPsi package provides the tools to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by initialising a calculation for O$_2$. We will first run a Hartree-Fock calculation to generate starting orbitals. The ground state of this molecule is a triplet, so we will use unrestricted HF. Note that full CI is exact and does not depend on the actual shape of the orbitals, so we could have run a singlet calculation instead without changing the result."

'2' indicates that the orbital is doubly occupied, 'a' and 'b' indicates an $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ electron, and '0' an empty orbital.

The answer to this is the Slater-Condon rules, see the section on [Slater Determinants](sec:slater). This rules define the matrix elements in terms of molecular integrals, depending on the difference in occupation between the 2 determinants. The difference in occupation is easily formulated in terms of excitations, with different rules depending on if $|j \\rangle$ is singly or doubly excited compared to $|i \\rangle$. Any higher excitation will simply lead to 0.\n",

    "The difficult part is to make sure that the occupations of the Slater determinants are brought to maximum concordance. The expansion produced by lexical ordering may not have this property, but one can switch electrons until we reach this maximum concordance, introducing a negative phase factor at each electron exchange. Again, MultiPsi provides a convenient way to achieve this. The idea is to explicitly create the singly excited determinant (or doubly excited by applying the operation twice) and then keep track of the number of exchanges to bring it to natural ordering. The excite_alpha and excite_beta functions do this, providing both the excited determinant and the phase factor. The index() function of the determinants then provides the index of the given determinant in the expansion, in order to associate the energy to the correct position in the Hamiltonian.\n",

    "One of the uses of the one-particle density matrix is that it allows an intuitive look at the correlated wavefunction by looking at the occupation number of the so-called natural orbitals. Indeed, while orbitals are originally born out of a mean-field theory and are technically not appropriate representations of a real (i.e., correlated) wavefunction, their intuitive power is undeniable. Natural orbitals generalize the concept of orbitals to correlated wavefunctions. The occupation numbers are now non-integer between 2 and 0, representing a sort of weighted average of the occupation across all configurations. By doing so, the occupation number offer a measure of correlation: occupations far from an integer value reflecting significant deviations from the mean-field picture, and thus significant correlation effects. Further discussion of these natural orbitals is included in the chapter on multiconfigurational methods."

It is interesting to note how the occupation often work in pairs summing up approximately to an integer.

The issue is  that the  number of determinants  grows very  fast (factorially) with the size of the system.  For example, a simple water molecule in a polarization double zeta basis, corresponding to 10 electrons and 24 orbitals, would require 903.316.260 determinants. While such a calculation is possible, it is very expensive, and it should be obvious from this example that full CI cannot be used on any real size system.\n",

The first one is to restrict excitations, and thus the number of determinants involved  in  the  calculation. After all, a single  SD  turned  out to be  a reasonable approximation in most cases. As a the Hamiltonian is a two-electron operator, a determinant only interacts directly with at most doubly excited determinants, which suggests that those are those which would contribute the most to the energy. This can easily be tested on a small molecule like water. "
