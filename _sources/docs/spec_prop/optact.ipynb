    "Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of a light beam that traverses it. It is usually expressed in terms of the so-called specific rotation, via an equation relating the angle through which the plane is rotated, the length of the light path through the sample, and the density of the sample, or its concentration for samples in solution. The specific rotation depends upon the temperature and upon the wavelength of the light. Conventionally, the rotation is assigned a positive value if it is clockwise with respect to an observer facing the light source, negative if counterclockwise. A substance displaying a positive specific rotation is described as dextrorotatory and denoted by the prefix $d$ or $(+)$; one with a negative specific rotation is levorotatory, designated by the prefix $l$ or $(-)$.
