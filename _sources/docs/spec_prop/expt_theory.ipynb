All other contributions vanish. Thus the optical sum frequency generation response (due to the interaction of the molecules solely with the optical electric fields composing the impinging radiation) can be seen only in chiral fluid, with an experimental setup with crossed optical electric fields of different angular frequency and aligning the detector along the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the polarization vectors (transversal).
