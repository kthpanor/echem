    "## The n-electron basis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in principle an infinite number of possible n-electron basis to choose from, but we ideally want the expansion to converge quickly (compact expansion) and the functions to be easily manipulatable to quickly compute the Hamiltonian elements. Naturally, these two criteria often go opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "As electron correlation depends on the distance between electrons, it would be natural to use functions that depend explicitely on this distance, the same way as our gaussian or Slater 1-electron basis depends explicitely on the distance between electron and nuclei. Wavefunction having this properties are typically called explicitly correlated wavefunctions, but this interelectronic distance makes the calculation of integrals very difficult as it couples multiple electrons together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often drop this explicit dependence and instead use a wavefunction that is simply formed from products of one-electron functions, i.e. product of orbitals. The simplest of these basis functions if the Hartree product, but since we know the wavefunction should be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons, we instead use the antisymmetrised version of the Hartree product: Slater determinants (SD). As each SD represents a different electronic configuration, the resulting method is called configuration interaction (CI). As discussed in the previous sections, this basis of SD constitutes a complete basis within a specified one-electron basis set, and thus the solution obtained by minimizing the energy of this wavefunction is the exact ground state within that one-electron basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some codes, configuration state functions (CSF) are used instead of SDs. CSF are fixed linear combinations of SD but with the attractive properties that they are also eigenfunctions of the $S^2$ spin operator. This spin constraints means that the resulting wavefunction will always be spin-adapted and also that CSF are less numerous than Slater Determinants which has advantages on a computational standpoint. However, SD can be expressed as ordered \"strings\" of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ creating operators, and this separation of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons allows to write efficient computer implementation, outweighing the benefits of the slightly smaller expansion of CSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having chosen SD as our basis functions, we now need an efficient way to create our expansion, i.e. a direct link between a given index in our expansion and the corresponding occupation of the SD. This link should work both ways, matching a given occupation to the corresponding index in the expansion. A common choice is the so-called lexical ordering or the reverse lexical ordering. The details are beyond the scope of this page, but fortunately, the MultiPsi package provide the tools to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by initialising a calculation for O$_2$. We will first run a Hartree-Fock calculation to generate starting orbitals. The ground state of this molecule is a triplet, but for the Hartree-Fock step we will simply run a singlet closed-shell. This is not an issue as full CI is exact and does not depend on the actual shape of the orbitals."

    "Note how the first (and lowest) energy is indeed lower than the one found at the Hartree-Fock level. This comes both from electron correlation and from using the correct triplet multiplicity. However, it is important to note that some of the states obtained here are not actually triplet but have a higher multiplicity. As we discussed in the previous section, the basis of Slater Determinant is not spin-adapted.  The only constraint in our expansion is the value of $m_s$, here $m_s = 1$, meaning we have two more $\\alpha$ electron than $\\beta$.

This rules define the matrix elements in terms of molecular integrals, depending on the difference in occupation between the 2 determinants. The difference in occupation is easily formulated in terms of excitations, with different rules depending on if $|j \\rangle$ is singly or doubly excited compared to $|i \\rangle$. Any higher excitation will simply lead to 0.\n",

    "The difficult part is to make sure that the occupations of the Slater determinants are brought to maximum concordance. The expansion produced by lexical ordering may not have this property, but one can switch electrons until we reach this maximum concordance, introducing a negative phase factor at each electron exchange. Again, MultiPsi provides a convenient way to achieve this. The idea is to explicitely create the singly excitated determinant (or doubly excited by applying the operation twice) and then keep track of the number of exchanges to bring it to natural ordering. The excite_alpha and excite_beta functions do this, providing both the excited determinant and the phase factor. The index() function of the determinants then provides the index of the given determinant in the expansion, in order to associate the energy to the correct position in the Hamiltonian.\n",

    "## Restricted CI\n",
    "\n",
    "This full CI method is only useful conceptually or for very small molecules as abenchmark reference. The issue is  that the  number of determinants  grow very  fast (factorially) with the size of the system.  For example, a simple water molecule in a polarization double zeta basis, corresponding to 10 electrons and 24 orbitals, would require 903.316.260 determinants. While such calculation is possible, it is very expensive, and it should be obvious from this example that fullCI cannot be used on any real size system.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, different directions can be taken to turn CI into a useful computational tool. The first one is to restrict excitations, and thus the number of determinants involved  in  the  calculation. After all, a single  SD  turned  out to be  a reasonable approximation in most cases. For small molecules, it is generally found that the doubly excitated determinants from the Hartree-Fock reference are the ones that contribute the most to the correlation energy. This can be easily understood since they are the only ones that interact directly with the Hartree-Fock determinant. This forms the so-called CI doubles, CID, or more often CI singles and doubles CISD, since the cost of single excitations is anyway smaller than that of doubles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with those truncated CI methods is that as the system grows larger, the importance of higher excitations increase, and thus truncated CI capture a smaller and smaller fraction of the correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very well illustrated when taking two identical molecules at large distance. One would normally expect the energy of this non-interacting dimer to be exactly twice that of the monomer. Let's verify it on a water molecule:"
