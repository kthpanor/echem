Vibrational spectroscopies
==========================
General aspects on calculating ground-state [IR](sec:ir-tutorial) and [Raman](sec:raman-tutorial) spectra of molecules are discussed in this section. The theoretical foundations on which IR and Raman calculations are based are discussed in details in the section on [Hessians](hessians:label).
