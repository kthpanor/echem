    "The following steps are carried out mostly by the geomeTRIC module {cite}`Wang2016`,\n",

    "The starting point for the vibrational analysis of molecules\n",
    "is the Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinates, $\\mathbf{H}^{\\text{Cart}}$,\n",
    "calculated either numerically or analytically as described above.\n",
    "Generally, the elements of $\\mathbf{H}^{\\text{Cart}}$ are given by second derivatives of the energy $E$\n",
    "with respect to nuclear displacement,\n",

    "```\n",
    "Hence, $\\mathbf{H}^{\\text{Cart}}$ is a $3N \\times 3N$ matrix (where $N$ is the number of atoms),\n",
    "and $\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots, \\xi_{3N}$ is used for the displacements\n",
    "of the Cartesian coordiates, $\\Delta x_1, \\Delta y_1, \\Delta z_1, \\ldots, \\Delta z_N$.\n",
    "The '$0$' subscript of the parentheses refers to the equilibrium geometry of the atoms at which the derivatives are taken,\n",
    "and that the first derivatives vanish.\n",

    "As a first step, the Hessian is converted to _mass-weighted_ Cartesian coordinates (MWC),\n",
    "$q_1 = \\sqrt{m_1} \\xi_1 = \\sqrt{m_1} \\Delta x_1$, $q_2 = \\sqrt{m_1} \\xi_2 = \\sqrt{m_1} \\Delta y_1$,\n",

    "Diagonalizing this Hessian gives $3N$ eigenvalues are the fundamental frequencies of the molecule,\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to remove translational and rotational degrees of freedom,\n",

    "```{math}\n",
    "%:label: eq:center_of_mass\n",
    "  \\mathbf{R}^{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{\\sum_{K} m_{K} \\mathbf{R}_K}{\\sum_{K} \\mathbf{R}_K} \\, ,\n",

    "where the sum runs over all atoms $K$, and the origin is then shifted to the COM,\n",
    "$\\mathbf{R}_{K}^{\\text{COM}} = \\mathbf{R}_K - \\mathbf{R}^{\\text{COM}}$.\n",
    "Subsequently, one determines the inertia tensor and diagonalizes it\n",
    "to obtain principal moments and axes of inertia.\n",
    "Next, one needs to find the transformation\n",
    "from mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates to a set of $3N$ coordinates,\n",
    "where the molecule's translation and rotation are separated out,\n",
    "leaving $3N - 6$ (or $3N-5$ for linear molecules) vibrational modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by applying the so-called Eckart conditions {cite}`Eckart1934`.\n",
    "While the three vectors of length $3N$ corresponding to translation are simply given by $\\sqrt{m_i}$\n",
    "times the coordinate axis, the vectors corresponding to rotational motion of the atoms\n",
    "are obtained from the coordinates of the atoms with respect to the COM\n",
    "and the corresponding row of the matrix used to diagonalize the moment of inertia tensor.\n",
    "In the next step, these vectors are normalized and a Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization\n",
    "is carried out to create $N_\\text{vib} = 3N-6$ (or $3N-5$) remaining vectors,\n",
    "which are orthogonal to the five or six translational and rotational vectors.\n",
    "Thus, one obtains a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ which allows for the transformation\n",
    "of the mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{q}$ to internal coordinates\n",
    "$\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{Dq}$, where translation and rotation have been projected out.\n",
    "%Thus, one obtains a basis in which translation and rotation\n",

    "which are related to the harmonic vibrational frequencies $\\nu_i$\n",
    "and $\\mathbf{L}$ is the transformation matrix composed of the eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i = 4 \\pi^2 \\nu_i^2$ can be converted from frequencies $\\nu_i$\n",
