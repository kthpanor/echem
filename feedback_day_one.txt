HF was difficult to follow;
- too fast
- HF more tutorial-like
- it was difficult to see/follow
- single point calculation as an example first; also to familiarize with veloxchem;

MP2:
- dipole moment equation -- not used in the code, it's confusing? (maybe not; ignore)
- intro to vlx; commands like numpy-einsum; intro to commands would have been good
- better explanation of t-amplitudes:


General:
- have an introduction to veloxchem and the other software
- intro to routines which are used often (like numpy einsum)
- more balance between theory and tutorial (balance throughout the entire workshop)
- TV screen not best option (projector, use zoom?)
- questionaire a few days before / 1-week before to be able to adapt the difficulty level
