# Localized properties

In this section, we will describe different ways to define and calculate local atomic properties that are use in classical representations of molecules. 

We will consider:

- [ESP atomic charges](sec:esp_charges)
- [RESP atomic charges](sec:resp_charges)
- [LoProp charges and polarizabilities](sec:loprop)
