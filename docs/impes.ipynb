    "# Potential energy surfaces by interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind PES by interpolation is to construct the global PES of the molecular ground or excited-state from a set of data points (configurations) calculated quantum-mechanically (QM). For small molecules with few degrees of freedom, depending on the level of theory, the interpolated PES can have similar computational cost as constructing the PES *ab initio*. On the other hand, the use of an interpolated PES becomes very advantageous, especially when the molecule of interest is embedded in a larger environment (e.g. fluorescent probe in a protein), where this technique allows performing dynamics on the ground or excited state with quantum chemical accuracy, but at molecular mechanics computational cost {cite}`rhee2016interpolation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind PES interpolation is to write the potential energy at a new configuration $\\mathbf{q}$ as a weighted average between potentials defined from a set of *ab initio* data points $\\{\\mathbf{q}_a\\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sum_a w_a V_a(\\mathbf{q})\\,,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the weights $w_a$ depend on the distance ($\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_a$) beween the new configuration $\\mathbf{q}$ and a data configuration $\\mathbf{q}_a$. The potentials $V_a$ are local harmonic potentials written in terms of Taylor expansions based on the energy ($E_a$), gradient ($\\mathbf{g}_a$) and Hessian ($\\mathbf{H}_a$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_a(\\mathbf{q}) = E_a + \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^\\mathrm{T}_a \\mathbf{g}_a + \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^\\mathrm{T}_a \\mathbf{H}_a\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_a\\, .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $\\mathbf{q}$ designating the position is in the internal coordinate system. The weights are provided by considering the distance between $\\mathbf{q}$ and $\\mathbf{q}_a$, such that the weight $w_a$ is larger for a data point $\\mathbf{q}_a$ that is closer to $\\mathbf{q}$. The weights $w_a$ are normalized weights: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "w_a = \\frac{v_a}{\\sum_i v_i}\\,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The exponent $2p$ determines how fast the algorithm switches between data points {cite}`kim2016impesLargeMol`. \n",
