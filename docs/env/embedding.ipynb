    "The [hybrid QM/MM approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QM/MM) for multiscale modeling of complex systems was recognized with the [Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2013](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/summary/). This model partitions the molecular system into a small quantum mechanical (QM) region containing up to a few hundred atoms and (typically) a larger molecular mechanical (MM) region containing up to several tens of thousands of atoms.\n",

    "Full or partial interactions (electrostatics, induction, dispersion, short-range repulsion) are accounted for in between the QM and MM parts of the system, resulting in a Hamiltonian of the form\n",
