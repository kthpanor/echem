    "In recent years, the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have become a rather widely used approach for  modeling molecules' electronic structure in complex environments. Most QM/MM methods partition the molecular system into a small QM region (up to few hundreds of atoms) and a large MM region (thousands of atoms). Full or partial coupling in intermolecular interactions (electrostatics, induction, dispersion, short-range repulsion) is accounted for between the QM and MM parts of the system, where each interaction acts both ways. The total energy of the molecular system in the QM/MM method is then partitioned into three contributions:  \n",

    "where the first term is the energy of the MM region, the second term is the interaction energy of the QM and MM regions, and the last term is the QM region energy. For bonded systems, the MM part of the system's residues is often subject to bond capping, and the QM and MM parts interface to approximations like atom in-linking.  \n",

    "Non-polarizable or polarizable force fields can describe the MM part with parameters (point charges, distributed polarizabilities) determined empirically or using quantum chemistry methods. After partitioning the molecular system into QM and MM regions and selecting interaction mode between these systems, the electronic wave function of the QM system can be determined by solving the wave function model specific equation in the presence of external potential generated by the MM region, including\n",
