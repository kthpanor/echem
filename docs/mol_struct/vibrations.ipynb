    "Hence, $\\mathbf{H}^{\\text{Cart}}$ is a $3N \\times 3N$ matrix (where $N$ is the number of atoms),\n",
    "and $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{3N}$ denote displacements of the Cartesian coordiates. The '$0$' subscript indicates that the second deriatives are taken at the equilibrium geometry, where the first derivatives (or gradient) vanish.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\bar{x}_1 = \\sqrt{m_1} x_1$, $\\bar{x}_2 = \\sqrt{m_1} x_2 $, $\\ldots$, $\\bar{x}_{3N} = \\sqrt{m_N} x_{3N}$, where $m_i$ is the mass of atom $i$, such that $\\mathbf{H}^{\\text{MWC}}$ is given by\n",

    "where the sum runs over all atoms $K$, and the origin is then shifted to the COM, $\\mathbf{R}_{K}^{\\text{COM}} = \\mathbf{R}_K - \\mathbf{R}^{\\text{COM}}$. Subsequently, one determines the inertia tensor and diagonalizes it\n",
    "to obtain principal moments and axes of inertia. Next, one needs to find the transformation from mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates to a set of $3N$ coordinates, where the molecule's translation and rotation are separated out,\n",
    "leaving $3N - 6$ (or $3N-5$ for linear molecules) vibrational modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by applying the so-called Eckart conditions {cite}`Eckart1934`. While the three vectors of length $3N$ corresponding to translation are simply given by $\\sqrt{m_i}$ times the coordinate axis, the vectors corresponding to rotational motion of the atoms are obtained from the coordinates of the atoms with respect to the COM and the corresponding row of the matrix used to diagonalize the moment of inertia tensor. In the next step, these vectors are normalized and a Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization is carried out to create $N_\\text{vib} = 3N-6$ (or $3N-5$) remaining vectors, which are orthogonal to the five or six translational and rotational vectors. Thus, one obtains a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ which allows for the transformation of the mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{\\bar{x}}$ to internal coordinates $\\mathbf{\\bar{q}} = \\mathbf{B\\bar{x}}$, where translation and rotation have been projected out.\n",
