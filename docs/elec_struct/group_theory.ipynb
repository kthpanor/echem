    "The set of symmetry operations that commute with the Hamiltonian form a group and thereby fulfill:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If operations $\\hat{P}$ and $\\hat{Q}$ are members if the group, so is $\\hat{R} = \\hat{P} \\hat{Q}$. The rule for the combined operation is that first is the operation of $\\hat{Q}$ completed and then is the action of $\\hat{P}$ performed.\n",
    "2. The set of operations contains $\\hat{I}$.\n",
    "3. The associate law applies, i.e., $\\hat{P}(\\hat{Q}\\hat{R}) = (\\hat{P}\\hat{Q})\\hat{R}$ for all operations.\n",
    "4. The inverse for all operations belongs to the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "By limiting ourselves to spatial symmetry, symmetry operations are restricted to geometric actions that leave the nuclear framework invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A symmetry element is a geometrical entity, e.g., a point, line, or plane, about which an action takes place. For every operation there is an associated element. At least one point in space is left unchanged for all symmetry operations and we refer to such groups as point groups to distinguish them from crystal groups that also possess translational symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five different kinds of symmetry operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The identity operation, $\\hat{I}$, does nothing.\n",
    "2. The rotation operation, $\\hat{C}_n$, rotates the system an angle $2\\pi/n$ about an axis. If the molecules possesses several rotation axes, the one with the largest $n$ is referred to as the principal axis.\n",
    "3. The reflection operation, $\\hat{\\sigma}$, reflects the system in a plane. If a plane is perpendicular to the principal axis, the operation is denoted $\\hat{\\sigma}_h$. If, on the other hand, it contains the principal axis, it is denoted $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$. Finally, if the plane bisects the angle between two $C_2$-axes, it is denoted $\\hat{\\sigma}_d$.\n",
    "4. The inversion operation, $\\hat{i}$, inverts space through the origin. \n",
    "5. The improper rotation (or rotoreflection) operation, $\\hat{S}_n = \\hat{\\sigma}_h \\hat{C}_n$, performs a combination of a rotation and a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. \n",
    "  \n",
    "It is noted that some symmetry operations are equivalent, e.g., $\\hat{S}_2 = \\hat{i}$."

Further, this $C_n$-axis cannot be affected by any operations such as reflection perpendicular to the axis, as this would interchange the ends. As a result, only molecules belonging to the point groups $C_n$, $C_{nv}$ and $C_s$ can have a dipole moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image is said to be *chiral*. This is exemplified by the inability of the left hand to be superimposed on the right hand, and it has the physical effect of rotating the plane of polarized light in opposite directions for the two different specimen. For a molecule to be chiral, it cannot contain a $S_n$-axis, an axis often implied by the presence of other symmetry elements (e.g. $\\sigma$ is equivalent to $S_1$)."
