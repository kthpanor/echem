There is a limited set of representations, known as irreducible representations (or irreps), from which any other representation can be deduced. They are brought together in a character table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A character table lists all the symmetry operations of a point group as columns and the irreducible representations as rows. The number of irreps in a group is equal to the number of conjugacy classes. For Abelian groups, the number of irreps is equal to the number of group elements, and all irreps are one-dimensional. Characters are simply the traces of the representatives\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Since traces of matrices are invariant under unitary transformations, characters literally characterize the representations. For a given representation, elements within the same conjugacy class have identical characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irreducible representation satisfy the Great Orthogonality Theorem (GOT). Let $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma'$ be two irreducible representations of a group $\\mathbf{G}$, and consider vectors formed by taking elements $ij$ and $kl$ from the respective representatives for every element of the group. These vectors are orthogonal to each other, and their squared norm is equal to the order of the group $g$, divided by the dimension of the irrep $\\ell$\n",

    "Other relations can be deduced from the GOT. For $i=j$ and $k=l$, consider two irreps $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma'$ with their strings of characters arranged in vectors.

    "In chemical applications, irreps are denoted by labels indicating their degeneracy. One-dimensional irreps are labeled $A$ and $B$, representing symmetric and antisymmetric states with respect to the principal element. Two- and three-dimensional representations are labeled $E$ and $T$, respectively. In some icosahedral groups, four- and five-dimensional irreps are labeled $G$ and $H$. Further subscripts, such as $g$ and $u$, distinguish between even (gerade) and odd (ungerade) symmetries with respect to spatial inversion. Primes and double primes indicate behavior concerning a $\\sigma_h$ plane. Numerical indices are used when multiple representations share the same label.\n",
