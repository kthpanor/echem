    "The utilization of the mathematical field of group theory (mainly representation theory, to be precise) is presented here as applied to quantum chemistry, where the methods of quantum mechanics are used to solve chemical problems. Using the concept from group theory for molecular symmetries, it is possible to both reach fundamental understanding of the physical processes involved in chemistry and to speed up quantum chemical computations."

    "Disregarding the possibility of translation actions (which are of relevance for crystals), a molecule can be manipulated in a series of ways that may leave the molecule invariant. A *symmetry operation* is such an action that leaves the molecules invariant, and therefore cannot change the physical properties of the molecules. This can be illustrated by considering a linear molecule, say carbon dioxide, and rotating this by any degrees along the axis intersecting the atoms. This action will move no atom of the molecules, and it is impossible this new geometry with the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corresponding to each such symmetry operation there exists an element, a geometrical entity, along which this action is taken: the *symmetry element*. This element may be an axis, a plane, the entire molecule or a point. In the previous example this would be the axis intersecting all atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible symmetry operations for a molecule includes:\n",
    "- The *identity* operator $I$. This operation consists of doing nothing, and is thus possible for all molecules.\n",
    "- The *rotation* operator $C_n$. This operation consists of rotating the molecule $(2\\pi/n)$ along some axis, this axis is then the $n$-fold axis of rotation. If the molecules possesses several $C_n$-axes, the one with the largest $n$ is referred to as the *principal axis*.\n",
    "- The *reflection* operator $\\sigma$. This operation consists of reflecting the molecule in a plane, leaving only the elements in the plane unaffected. If the molecule also have axes of rotational symmetries, the reflection plane is called a *vertical* reflection, designated $\\sigma_v$, if any such axes are contained in the plane. If the reflection/mirror plane is instead orthogonal to the axes it is called an horizontal mirror plane, designated $\\sigma_h$. Finally, if the plane bisects the angle between two $C_2$ axes, it is called a dihedral mirror plane, $\\sigma_d$.\n",
    "- The *inversion* operator $i$. This operation consists of inverting all point in the molecule through a single point. If this symmetry element is chosen as origin, this corresponds to $(x,y,z) \\to (-x,-y,-z)$.\n",
    "- The *improper rotation* operator $S_n$. This operation corresponds to rotating of molecule by $(2\\pi/n)$, followed by a   reflection through the plane orthogonal to this rotational axis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It should be noted that several symmetry operations are equivalent, *e.g.* $S_1$ is the same as $\\sigma$, $C_1$ the same as $I$.\n",

These groups are called *point groups*, as they leave at least one point unaffected irregardless of the symmetry operation acted upon the molecule (of those allowed for the group). The notation of the group classification will here follow in accordance to the *Shoenflies* system, but we note that a different system, the *Hermann--Mauguin* system is also used (this last system also contains translation symmetries, for use in periodic crystals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the point group for an arbitrary molecule can be done by consulting a flow chart constructed for this determination:\n",

    "- As a (static) *dipole moment* is a result of an asymmetric charge distribution, it is not possible to have a dipole moment along any other axis than a $C_n$-axis. Further, this $C_n$-axis cannot be affected by any operations such as reflection perpendicular to the axis, as this would interchange the ends. As a result, only molecules belonging to the point groups $C_n$, $C_{nv}$ and $C_s$ can have a dipole moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image is said to be *chiral*. This is exemplified by the inability of the left hand to be superimposed on the right hand, and it has the physical effect of rotating the plane of polarized light in opposite directions for the two different specimen. For a molecule to be chiral, it cannot contain a $S_n$-axis, an axis often implied by the presence of other symmetry elements (e.g. $\\sigma$ is equivalent to $S_1$).\n",

    "### Mathematical groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mathematical field of group theory, a *group* is defined as a set of elements with an operation of combination obeying the following rules:\n",

    "- The combination of two elements in the group as by the operation must produce an element of the group, i.e. if $A$ and $B$ belongs to the group, $C=AB$ belongs to the group.\n",

    "For the case of molecular symmetries, the group elements of interest are the symmetry operations above, with a combination rule consisting of one operation followed by another.

    "\n",
    "In the case of symmetry groups in chemistry, the combination rule is given above as one operation followed by another.

    "### Determination of integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "In many instances in quantum chemistry one wishes to determine a number of different integrals, such as overlap integrals, expectation values of some operators, etc. Using group theory it is possible to predict if a specific integral must be, by necessity, zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a one-dimensional function, integrated from $-a$ to $a$. It is trivial to see that this integral must be equal to zero if the function (integrand) is odd. In more general terms we may have more then one dimension, thus making the discussion less intuitive, but we can safely say that the integral (being a number) must be invariant under any symmetry operation. Thus, in order for the integral to be non-zero, the integrand must transform as the totally symmetric irrep in the point group. Note that the function does not always transform as a single irrep, but then it must *include* the totally symmetric irrep. Note further that this only determines whether an integral is necessarily zero: it may, however, be zero for any other reason.\n",

We should then construct the SALCs from a set of basis functions (in the case of molecular bonds, only the basis functions of the valence electrons are of interest) and take linear combination of those SALCs to find the bonds. Note that this only gives the form of the functions, the coefficients of the linear combinations cannot be determined by group theoretical consideration. The SALCs will in this case simplify the calculations by yielding a subproblem for each irrep, in which the molecular orbitals can be formed, rather determining all molecular orbitals of the molecules simultaneously."
