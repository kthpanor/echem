    "Around the equilibrium distance, BLYP performs remarkably well. Actually, since we are only using a small DZ basis set, it is likely that the FullCI curve is too high and the true answer is closer to the BLYP curve. On the other hand, approaching dissociation, BLYP follows the same trend as Hartree-Fock and goes above the 0 which represents the energy of the 2 separate hydrogens, though with a significantly smaller error than Hartree-Fock.\n",

    "It is interesting to note that the issue with strong correlation is only present because we use spin-densities. If we were using only the total density (which is what the fundamental theorems of DFT suggest), then H$_2$ would dissociate to the correct limit even with restricted DFT, and this would be true for any (reasonable) functional. The issue at dissociation is because the restricted wavefunction is not spin-polarized while the open-shell fragments are, and thus they have different energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the reason most modern DFT uses spin-densities is because it usually gives better results, and in particular, it can distinguish between a triplet and open-shell singlet while these two states tend to have very similar densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, in the absence of magnetic field (or relativistic effect), it is actually unphysical to spin-polarize, since space is isotropic. This has led to attempts to find another variable that is more physical that the spin-densities but carries more information that just the total density.\n",

    "The on-top pair-density $\\Pi(r)$ has been the most promising idea. This quantity is simply the pair-density $\\rho_2(r_1,r_2)$ but for $r_1 = r_2 = r$. In other words, it represents the probability of having two-electrons in the same point in space (\"on-top\" of each other, hence the name).\n",

    "This result appears weird at first, because the $\\alpha$ density we obtain is clearly larger than the $\\beta$, which we do not expect in a singlet. Here it is important to remember that these are only \"effective\" densities which correspond to the physical spin densities only in a single determinant. In addition, we arbitrarily chose the larger one to be the $\\alpha$, and you could easily imagine that on the right-side we could choose the reverse and the result would then look more like the broken-symmetry result.\n",

By contrast, in the outer regions, the $\\alpha$ density becomes very large compared to the $\\beta$, which is reminescent of the broken-symmetry solution we found earlier, reflecting the correlation effects in this region. However, unlike the broken-symmetry solution, this distribution retains the left-right symmetry of the system.\n",

    "Let us briefly come back to the problem of negative number under the radical. The on-top pair-density is bounded $0<\\Pi(r)<\\rho^2(r)$ and for a closed-shell single determinant case, $\\Pi = 2\\rho_\\alpha \\rho_\\beta = 0.5 \\rho^2$. This means the quantity under the radical is positive if the probability of finding two electrons in the same space is lower than that of a closed-shell single determinant, which is often the case since correlation tends to reduce this probability. But it may not always be so, locally, and in particularly in the middle of the bond here, where it would give a complex number. This is however not a problem in practice, as if we simply blindly apply the usual density functional expressions on a complex density, we get an increased energy, which is what we would expect from having a high probability of two electrons in the same place.\n",

However, we can compute these with a level of theory like MCSCF which is able to dissociate properly but lacks dynamical correlation.
