    "# Hartree--Fock\n",
    "\n",
    "With the state of the system being described by a single Slater determinant, the Hartree--Fock (HF) wave function is given as that which minimizes the electronic energy in a variational sense with respect to variations in the spin orbitals. It represents a cornerstone in quantum chemistry and provides total electronic energies that are within 1% of the exact results and a wide range of molecular properties that are within 5–10% accuracy. Moreover, the Hartree--Fock method serves as starting points for the formulation of many other, more accurate, wave function methods as well as the [Kohn–Sham](kohn-sham) formulation of density functional theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss:\n",
    "- The [theory](hf_theory) underlying the Hartree--Fock method, as well as many other methods in quantum chemistry\n",
    "- The implementation of a [self-consistent field](hf_scf) procedure\n",
    "- Examples on how to [diagonalize the Fock matrix](fock_diagonalize), and removing linear dependencies in the basis set\n",
    "- An [example](hf_example) of how to use the HF implementation in VeloxChem, as well as visualizing molecular orbitals"
