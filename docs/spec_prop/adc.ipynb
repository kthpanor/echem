    "# Algebraic-diagrammatic construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for the polarization propagator provides a series of _ab initio_ methods to describe excited electronic states and related properties based on the MÃ¸ller--Plesset perturbation theory partition of the Hamiltonian {cite}`Dreuw2015`. Due to their size consistency, ADC methods are suited for the calculation of large molecules and their Hermitian structure and the availability of the intermediate state representation (ISR) allow for straightforward computation of excited-state and state-to-state properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADC is a general procedure and not restricted to the polarization propagator, but to all propagators such as the electron propagator for the calculation of ionization potentials and electron affinities or the two-particle propagator for the calculation of double ionization potentials {cite}`Dreuw2015`. On the following pages, an outline of the underlying theory for ADC is given, including\n",
