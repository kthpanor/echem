    "quadrupole and higher-order moments. The traceless multipole  moments describe the deviation from an isotropic charge distribution.  For instance, the traceless quadrupole moment vanishes for a spherical charge distribution when the center of the sphere coincides with the origin, since the transformation from the primitive (traced) quadrupole moment $q_{\\alpha\\beta}$ to the traceless quadrupole moment $\\Theta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ eliminates \n",
    "the isotropic contribution.  The traceless multipole moment of order $n$ is defined by $2n+1$ components, whereas the traced tensor involves $(n+2)(n+1)/2$ independent quantities. A tabulation of non-zero symmetry-independent elements of multipole moments ($\\mu$ = dipole, $\\Theta$ = quadrupole, $\\Omega$ = octupole and $\\Phi$ = hexadecapole) for different point groups is given elsewhere {cite}`kielichrev` . \n",

The next,higher-order multipole moments depend on the choice of origin, and when computed with respect to the origin of the coordinate system, they depend on the position of the molecule in space.  This can be seen from the form of the the electric dipole operator\n",
