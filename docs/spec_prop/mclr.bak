    "# Linear response\n",

    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "So-far we have seen CI response and how pure CASCI response can fail dramatically due to the neglect of orbital relaxation. We fixed it in a simple way using state-averaging, but this also introduced some difficulties, such as the dependency of the result on the number of states and the need to include all orbitals involved in the excitation in the active space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These difficulties can be avoided altogether by deriving a proper linear response for MCSCF. For this, we introduce our parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  | \\bar{\\psi}(t) \\rangle = e^{-i\\hat{\\kappa}(t)} e^{-i\\hat{R}(t)} |0\\rangle \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which contains both the orbital rotation operator similar to HF or DFT response\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\hat{\\kappa}(t) =\n",
    "  \\sum_a^\\mathrm{act,unocc} \\sum_i^\\mathrm{occ,act} \\left[\n",
    "    \\kappa_{ai}(t) \\hat{a}^\\dagger_a \\hat{a}_i + \\kappa_{ai}^*(t) \\hat{a}^\\dagger_i \\hat{a}_a\n",

    "but also the CI state-transfer operator\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\hat{R}(t) = \\sum_n R_{n0}(t) | n \\rangle \\langle 0 | + R^*_{0n}(t) | 0 \\rangle \\langle n | $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For CASSCF wave functions, there is a redundancy between the active-active orbital response parameters and the CI response parameters, so these orbital response terms are dropped. The orbital rotations are thus restricted to inactive-active, inactive-virtual and active-virtual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory can thus be seen as CASCI response but with added orbital excitations to and from non-active orbitals. Hence, it fixes the lack of orbital relaxation of CASCI and also lifts the need to include all orbitals involved in the excitations within our active space. The only difference between having the orbitals inside or outside the active space is the description of the reference state (typically the ground state) and the fact that the CI state-transfer includes all order of excitations while the orbital operators are restricted to single excitations."

    "The orbital analysis shows the weights of the CI and orbital contribution to each response vector. Even if all of those states correspond broadly to excitations between valence orbitals which are all in the active space, all contain a sizeable contribution to the orbital response, which explains why they were so poorly described by CASCI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go even further and drop the oxygen lone pair from our active space. As seen in the occupation number of the CASSCF calculation, the first orbital (the lone pair) is almost perfectly doubly occupied, and was only added in our active space because it is the HOMO of our system and is thus excited in the lowest excited states. Since we now also include excitations outside of the active space, we can safely remove this orbital and focus on the 2 pairs of O-H $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ (4 electrons in 4 orbitals):"
