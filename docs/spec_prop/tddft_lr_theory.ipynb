    "Compared to atomic fields, the externally applied electromagnetic fields are several orders of magnitude weaker and perturbation theory is called for. Such an approach provide response functions a distinct separation of one-, two-, three-photon, *etc.*, optical processes, and virtually all spectroscopic properties are encompassed by the theory as possible perturbations include\n",

    "When an external field is applied to a molecular system the system interacts with this field and responds to the applied perturbation. If such field is of sufficiently small field strength, *i.e.* sufficiently small intensity, we can address the response using perturbation theory with the perturbed Hamiltonian\n",

    "where $\\hat{H}_0$ is the Hamiltonian of the isolated system and $\\hat{V}(t)$ described the quantum mechanical field-coupling. The requirement of a weak perturbation is met for most externally applied fields --- for example, a conventional laser with an intensity of 0.3 GW/cm$^3$ corresponds to an electric field amplitude of $\\sim$$5 \\times 10^{-5}$ a.u., which indeed has a small influence on a molecular system.\n",

For example, the polarizability may be obtained through the second derivative of the energy with respect to a perturbing electric field, while the first derivative corresponds to the permanent dipole moment, both at zero field strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time-dependent perturbing fields, the interaction between the field and the molecular system yields ill-defined energies due to exchange of energy between the field and the molecule.

    "The derivation of expressions for response functions can appear very different from one source to another and the vast number of technicalities can at first appear overwhelming. The principle, however, is quite straightforward and clear: Form a well-defined quantity of interest, e.g., the electric dipole moment, $\\mu(t)$, and identify response functions in the order expansions of these quantities.
