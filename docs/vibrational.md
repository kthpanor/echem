Vibrational spectroscopies
==========================
General aspects on calculating ground-state [infrared (IR)](sec:ir-tutorial) and [Raman](sec:raman-tutorial) spectra of molecules are discussed in this section. The theoretical foundations on which IR and Raman calculations are based are discussed in details in the section on [Hessians](hessians:label).

If in the previous sections of this chapter (link to UV-vis and X-ray spectroscopy) the main focus has been on transition between electronic levels, the focus here is on transitions between vibrational levels. These transitions are also a result of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation with the molecular system. {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-vibspec>` illustrates some of the physical processes which excite molecular vibrational levels. The simplest process is the linear absorption of infrared (IR) light. The energies carried by IR photons are of the same order of magnitude as the energy separation between different vibrational levels (see also  {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-radiation>`).  the  TODO: add more detailed description.

The electromagnetic radiation spectrum of interest for IR and Raman spectroscopy (marked in yellow). The inelastic scattering of UV or visible monochromatic radiation is involved in Raman spectroscopy, while the absorption of IR photon is involved in IR absorption spectroscopy.
