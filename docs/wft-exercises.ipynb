    "### One-particle density matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to compute the one-particle density matrix for a CI wavefunction. The structure of the code is very similar to that of the energy, and actually, the energy can be computed directly from the one- and two-particle density matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the density matrix (in molecular orbital basis) is defined in second quantization as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "D_{pq} = \\langle 0 | \\hat{a}_p^\\dagger \\hat{a}_q | 0 \\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indeed very similar to the one-electron part of the $\\sigma$ vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^{(1)} = \\sum_{pq} \\hat{a}_p^\\dagger \\hat{a}_q | 0 \\rangle h_{pq}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference then with the sigma algorithm is that instead of adding the $h_{ia}$ integral to the $\\sigma$ vector, we store the product of the coefficients (`vector[idet]` and `vector[excdet.index()]`) in the \"i,a\" position of the density matrix. Note that the diagonal term $D_{pp}$ includes a loop over all occupied $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals.\n",
