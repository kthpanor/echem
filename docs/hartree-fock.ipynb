    "# Hartree--Fock theory\n",
    "With the state of the system being described by a single Slater determinant, the Hartree--Fock wave function is given as that which minimizes the electronic energy in a variational sense with respect to variations in the spin orbitals. It represents a cornerstone in quantum chemistry and provides total electronic energies that are within 1% of the exact results and a wide range of molecular properties that are within 5--10% accuracy. Moreover, the Hartree--Fock method serves as starting points for the formulation of a multitude of other, more accurate, wave function methods as well as the Kohn--Sham formulation of density functional theory.\n",
