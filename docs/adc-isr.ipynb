    "As the name suggest, the intermediate state representation (ISR) approach consists of constructing the ADC matrix with the help of intermediate states $\\ket{\\tilde{\\Psi}_I}$, obtained by applying excitation operators to the ground state $\\ket{0}$. In [second quantization](secondquant.ipynb), the excitation operator is written as $\\hat{C}_I=\\{ \\hat{a}_a^\\dagger\\hat{a}_i;\\hat{a}_a^\\dagger\\hat{a}_b^\\dagger\\hat{a}_j\\hat{a}_i, a<b, i<j;... \\}$, where the indices $a,b...$ refer to unoccupied orbitals, while $i,j...$ represent occupied orbitals {cite}`Schirmer1991,Mertins1996,Schirmer2004`. Schematic representations of single and double excitations, which are the only two excitation classes that are needed for ADC up to third order in perturbation theory, are depicted in below figure:\n",

This can be easily seen in {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-propagator>`, where the zeroth and first order terms are related to single excitations (only one particle-hole pair is involved), while second order terms involve double excitations (two particle-hole pairs are involved).

However,to include all these excitations would make the ADC matrix intractably large and impossible to diagonalize for all but the smallest of systems. In practice, therefore, only the lowest $n$ excited states are ever constructed, where $n$ is the number of states requested by the user. This means that the space of valence excitations is easily accessible, but makes the space of core excitations impossible to reach, except for molecules with very few electrons.

On the other hand, while the secular matrices of both ADC and CI are symmetric, this is not true for CC schemes because the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$ is not Hermitian, which complicates the calculation of excited-state and transition properties {cite}`Schirmer2010`.\n",
