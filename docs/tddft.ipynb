This mapping is defined by solving the time-dependent SE with a fixed initial state $\\phi$ and calculating the corresponding densities $\\rho (r,t)$.\n",

At the top level, these failures manifest themselves in incorrect charge transfer and Rydberg excitation energies, along with poor activation barriers. The latter includes an incorrect one-particle excitation energy spectrum, the lack of an integer discontinuity when adding and removing an electron, and the pervasive self-interaction error. These affect the accuracy of charge-transfer excited states, Rydberg excited states, and activation barriers, which are among the best-known deficiencies of KS applications.\n",
