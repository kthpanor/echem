    "\n",
    "Calculate the chemical shift between the two -**C**H$_2$ and -**C**F$_2$ ionization energies, $1s \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\ast}$ core-excitation energies (XAS), and $\\pi \\rightarrow 1s$ core-decay energies (XES) of 1,1-difluoroethene. How do the chemical shifts of the different spectroscopies compare, and what do you think is the reason for any (dis)similarlities?\n",

    "Focus on ionization energy (harder with XES and XAS, but can include for comparison...). Look at neon, trying to capture the correct energy with $\\Delta$SCF. Using a 6-31G* basis set, add a single s-function with different exponents. Plot this. Where is the resulting IE the closest to experiment? What does it tell you?\n",

    "Starting with the ground-state model used to calculate X-ray emission spectra, adapt this to instead consider X-ray absorption spectra of 1,1-difluoroethene (energies from $\\epsilon_c - \\epsilon_v$, intensities from $| \\langle \\psi_c | \\hat{\\mu} | \\psi_v \\rangle |^2$). How does the absolute energies compare to experiment? What about relative features?\n",
