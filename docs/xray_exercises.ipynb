    "- Calculate the spectra of difluoroethene and assign the features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study how the region above the IE changes with more and more diffuse basis functions\n",

    "- Adapt the overlap model discussed for XES to XAS and see how this compares to, e.g., TDDFT\n",

    "## X-ray emission spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look at the first feature of the emission spectra of the donor and acceptor in a water dimer. Why does the intensity shift so much? (tip: look at MOs/NTOs, compare to the water monomer)"
