    "## Strong/static correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from perturbation theory, the largest contributions to the correlation energy typically come from small denominators, that is from excitation from and to orbitals around the Fermi level. This suggest using a multi-scame approach to correlation, with an accurate method to describe correlation coming from a few orbitals located near the Fermi level and a cheaper but less accurate method for the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in some situations, a few orbitals can have such large correlation effects that most electronic structure methods fail, sometimes dramatically. In those situations, the Hartree-Fock reference, upon which most other electronic structure methods are based, is not even qualitatively correct. One of the few methods able to describe such system is configuration interaction, which then shows several determinants with significant weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple example of this is what happens during homolytic bond dissociation."

    "## The Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field method (MCSCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the CASCI can be performed after a Hartree-Fock calculation, it has a major flaw in that the orbitals were optimized assuming the Hartree-Fock density was reasonable. But the main motivation behind CASCI was precisely that the Hartree-Fock density was wrong, and thus the Hartree-Fock orbitals are far from optimal. It is thus tempting to want to optimize the orbitals using the CASCI density. Of course, as the orbitals change, it is likely the CASCI would also need to be relaxed. Clearly, the process need to be self-consistent. The resulting method is called the multiconfigurational self-consistent field method (MCSCF), and if we used a complete active space, it can be called more specifically CASSCF.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCSCF can be seen as a generalization of the self-consistent field concept of Hartree-Fock to a wavefunction containing several determinants. It simultaneously relaxes the orbitals and the CI coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrative example\n",
    "Let us illustrate the MCSCF method by applying it to our O-H dissociation problem. As we mentioned, an active space containing the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ is enough to qualitatively describe the bond-breaking. The simplest way to define this active space in the program is to mention the number of active orbitals (here 2) as well as the number of electrons in them (here also 2). We often use the notation CAS($m,n$) with $m$ the number of electrons and $n$ the number of orbitals."

    "The result looks a bit disappointing. On one side, the MCSCF converges without major issue (unlike Hartree-Fock) and indeed approaches the FCI result at long distances. However, at short distances it did no better than HF, resulting in a weird transition between the two zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights one of the main difficulties in MCSCF. It is not enough to provide the number of active orbitals, it is essential to provide the right ones. By default, our CAS(2,2) includes the HOMO and LUMO, but at short distances, the HOMO is an oxygen lone pair, not the $\\sigma$. We can fix this by explicitely requesting the HOMO-1 in these cases"

This way, it is enough to find the right orbitals for the first point, and hopefully, the active space will be stable over the entire scan (similarly for optimization or dynamics). In any case, it is always a good idea to check that the final orbitals (after convergence) are the ones you want."

    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the theory below, it is recommended to first read the chapter on Hartree-Fock and Configuration Interaction as this section borrows extensively from both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCSCF wavefunction contains both CI and orbital parameters and can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "| \\Psi_{MCSCF} \\rangle = e^{-\\hat{\\kappa}} (\\sum_I c_I | \\mathbf{I} \\rangle)\n",

    "\n",
    "with $\\hat{\\kappa}$ the orbital rotation operator\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\kappa} = \\sum_{p<q} \\kappa_{pq} (\\hat{E}_{pq} - \\hat{E}_{qp})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often simpler to treat the optimization as two separate problems, an optimization of the CI coefficient followed by an optimization of the orbitals. Doing so means neglecting the coupling between the two occuring in the Hessian ($\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial c_I \\partial \\kappa_{pq}}$), and the method is thus \"first order\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The CI optimization can be done following the standard CI techniques seen in a previous chapter. However, the orbital optimization needs more inspection. The general expression of the orbital derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\kappa_{pq}} = 2 (F_{pq} - F_{qp})\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $D$ and $\\Gamma$ the one and two-particle density matrices.\n",
    "For a Hartree-Fock wavefunction, the one-particle density is diagonal with an occupation number of 2 for all occupied orbitals and $\\Gamma_{pqrs} = D_{pq}D_{rs} - \\frac{1}{2} D_{pr}D_{qs}$ , and the equation then simplifies to the usual Fock matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_{pq}^{\\mathrm{HF}} = 2h_{pq} + 2\\sum_{s} 2(pq|ss) - (ps|qs)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCSCF matrix is more complicated, and we can see two cases depending on if $p$ is inactive or active:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_{iq} = 2h_{iq} + 2\\sum_j 2(iq|jj) - (ij|qj) + \\sum_{tu} D_{tu} [2 (iq|tu) − (it|qu)]\n",

    "In HF, the Fock matrix is diagonalized, and it is easy to see how doing so indeed sets the gradient $2(F_{pq}-F_{qp})$ to 0. However, the MCSCF matrix is not symmetric and cannot in general be diagonalized. Note that the inactive-inactive block looks very similar to a Hartree-Fock Fock matrix and can be diagonalized, which defines the orbital energies for the inactive orbitals.\n",

Similarly, the exact orbital-orbital Hessian includes integrals in the molecular orbital (MO) basis with inactive and virtual indices. Since the transformation to the MO basis is expensive, we want to restrict it to only active indices (which are needed for the CI). It is thus customary to use an approximation even for the orbital-orbital Hessian which uses only matrix elements already used for the gradients and is diagonal:\n",
