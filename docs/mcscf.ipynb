    "## Strong/static correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from perturbation theory, the largest contributions to the correlation energy typically come from small denominators, that is from excitation from and to orbitals around the Fermi level. This suggest using a multi-scame approach to correlation, with an accurate method to describe correlation coming from a few orbitals located near the Fermi level and a cheaper but less accurate method for the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in some situations, a few orbitals can have such large correlation effects that most electronic structure methods fail, sometimes dramatically. In those situations, the Hartree-Fock reference, upon which most other electronic structure methods are based, is not even qualitatively correct. One of the few methods able to describe such system is configuration interaction, which then shows several determinants with significant weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple example of this is what happens during homolytic bond dissociation."

    "## The Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field method (MCSCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the CASCI can be performed after a Hartree-Fock calculation, it has a major flaw in that the orbitals were optimized assuming the Hartree-Fock density was reasonable. But the main motivation behind CASCI was precisely that the Hartree-Fock density was wrong, and thus the Hartree-Fock orbitals are far from optimal. It is thus tempting to want to optimize the orbitals using the CASCI density. Of course, as the orbitals change, it is likely the CASCI would also need to be relaxed. Clearly, the process need to be self-consistent. The resulting method is called the multiconfigurational self-consistent field method (MCSCF), and if we used a complete active space, it can be called more specifically CASSCF.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCSCF can be seen as a generalization of the self-consistent field concept of Hartree-Fock to a wavefunction containing several determinants. It simultaneously relaxes the orbitals and the CI coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrative example\n",
    "Let us illustrate the MCSCF method by applying it to our O-H dissociation problem. As we mentioned, an active space containing the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ is enough to qualitatively describe the bond-breaking. The simplest way to define this active space in the program is to mention the number of active orbitals (here 2) as well as the number of electrons in them (here also 2). We often use the notation CAS($m,n$) with $m$ the number of electrons and $n$ the number of orbitals."

    "The result looks a bit disappointing. On one side, the SCF converges without major issue (unlike Hartree-Fock) and indeed approaches the FCI result at long distances. However, at short distances it did no better than HF, resulting in a weird transition between the two zones.\n",

    "This highlights one of the main difficulties in MCSCF. It is not enough to provide the number of active orbitals, it is essential to provide the right ones. By default, our CAS(2,2) including the HOMO and LUMO, but at short distances, the HOMO is an oxygen lone pair, not the $\\sigma$. We can fix this by explicitely requesting the HOMO-1 in these cases"

In any case, it is always a good idea to check that the final orbitals (after convergence) are the ones you want."
