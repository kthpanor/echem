# Wave function theory

In this section we will describe commonly adopted wave function methods.

- [General aspects](wft-general) <br>
An overview of general concepts of wavefunction methods, such as the variational principle, electron correlation, and perturbation theory.
- [Hartree--Fock](hartree-fock) <br>
Introduction to the concepts of Hartree-Fock theory and an implementation of the self-consistent field algorithm.
- [Configuration interaction](ci) <br>
A presentation and implementation of full and truncated configuration interaction methods.
- [Møller--Plesset](mp2) <br>
A description and implementation of second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory.
