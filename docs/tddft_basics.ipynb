    "Compared to exact-state theory, the first and foremost difference is that, in approximate-state methods, state vectors are in general not eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian but are rather formed in terms of Slater determinants. Apart from this, the steps to be taken in the derivation of response functions are very similar in the two situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hartree--Fock and Kohn--Sham density functional theory, the reference state is described by a single Slater determinant, also referred to as the self-consistent field (SCF) approximation. The detailed derivation of response functions in this approximation can be found in {cite}`Norman2018`, but the key steps are indicated below.\n",
