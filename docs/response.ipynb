    "# Response theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will describe different methods for considering molecular properties, as obtained using response theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Exact states](exact-response.ipynb) <br>\n",
    "Provides an overview of general concepts of response theory for the case of exact states, including Ehrenfest theorem and the complex polarization propagator.\n",
    "- [Configuration interaction and state-averaged MCSCF](ci-response.ipynb) <br>\n",
    "Discuss how properties can be calculated using (truncated) CI and MCSCF.\n",
    "- [Time-Dependent Hartreeâ€“Fock](scf-response.ipynb) <br>\n",
    "Considers the linear response function for SCF methods, with focus on Hartree--Fock.\n",
    "- [TDDFT](tddft) <br>\n",
    "Focuses on the calculation of molecular properties using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), including challenges such as choice of exchange-correlation functionals, and considering charge-transfer states.\n",
    "- [Exercises](response_exercises.ipynb) <br>\n",
    "Contains exercises considering CI, SA-MCSCF, and TDSCF."
