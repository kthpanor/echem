# Create a conda environment for the eChem book

Using the echem.yml file (stored at the root of the echem directory) to create a conda environment `echem` will install all needed packages to compile the book.

```
conda env create -f echem.yml
```

# Some commands

This more "manual" installation of specfic packages should no longer be needed.

```
$ pip install -U jupyter-book
$ git clone https://github.com/kthpanor/echem.git
$ cd echem
$ vi docs/dft.md
$ jupyter-book build .
$ open _build/html/index.html
```

**Note**: We need version 0.11 (or higher) to compile our book which is not yet available with `conda install` so therefore do `pip install` as suggested above.

# Publish the html-version

```
$ pip install ghp-import
$ ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html
```

# References
The file `references.bib` in the top directory is a regular BIBTEX file. Add your references in this file. A citation in the text is added with

```
{cite}`Wang2016, Schlegel2011`
```

Multiple lists of references are possible but not yet propoerly implmented.
