struct-opt:
	some mistakes in the exercise:
		- set ostream state back to original before return!; 
		- print text! Conjugate gradient instead of gradient descent
		- grad_driver vs gradient_driver!! global vs local object
		- too easy / short: remove everything from the conjugate gradient; leave entire routine empty
		- list of iterations not neeed -- make from last iteration

impes:
	B2: mapping between (qi,qj) -> (xi,xj) why is just the "diagonal used".
	d2 qi / dxi dxj
	why is B2 as it is? -- why
	derivation of the transformation from Cartesian to internal:
	- start with Hessian in Cartesian, transform to q, switch indices, use matrices
	and you get equation!

	- grasp the concept of IM-PES 
	- easy to set up the molecule, etc., energy grad, hess
	- equations not clear;
	- too long?

vibrational spec:
	- geometry opt
	- scf
	- hessian
	- isotope substitution?

MCSCF:
	- enough time for exercises
	- useful, insightfull
	- MO visualizer very nice;
	- amazing!
	- great!
	- KA would have liked everything derived, but not enough time
	- CI -- straightforward; J. take a look by himself

X-ray:
	- many choices;
	- relativistic corrections: 
	- XAS, RIXS at ADC level; pretty good
	-
